# Server Implementations

This codebase includes several server implementations designed to handle various types of web and WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) requests. Below is a brief overview of each server:

## 1. [`EchoWebServer`](./EchoWebServer/)

The `EchoWebServer` is a simple web server that echoes back any request it receives. It is primarily used for testing and debugging purposes, allowing developers to verify that their requests are being sent and received correctly.

## 2. [`MultiConnectWebServer`](./MultiConnectWebServer/)

The `MultiConnectWebServer` is designed to handle multiple simultaneous connections. This server can manage multiple clients at once, making it suitable for applications that require concurrent user interactions, such as chat applications or real-time data feeds.

## 3. [`AppWebServer`](./AppWebServer/)

The `AppWebServer` serves as a more robust web server with application-layer protocol implemented.

## 4. [`WSGIServer`](./WSGIServer/)

The `WSGIServer` implements the WSGI standard, allowing Python web applications to communicate with web servers. This server acts as a bridge between web servers and Python applications, enabling the deployment of Python web frameworks like Flask and Django.

## 5. [`MultiConnectWSGIServer`](./MultiConnectWSGIServer/)

The `MultiConnectWSGIServer` extends the functionality of the `WSGIServer` by supporting multiple concurrent WSGI applications. This server is designed for  environments where multiple applications need to be served simultaneously, ensuring efficient resource utilization and responsiveness.
